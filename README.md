Hi, my name is Leavinish Balasubramaniam. I’m currently working at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) as a contract staff (Pembantu Tadbir N1 - PSH), and at the same time, I’m pursuing my degree in Computer Science, majoring in Network and Security. I’m currently in my first year of study.

Even though I come from a non-Computer Science background, I’ve developed a strong passion for the field and enjoy exploring topics related to technology, especially cybersecurity and networking. I love learning how systems work and how I can apply my knowledge to solve real-life problems.

I live in Johor Bahru and I’m currently single. Outside of work and studies, I enjoy spending time with my hobbies—gardening, keeping pet fish, cleaning and organizing my space, and cooking. These activities help me relax, stay focused, and bring balance to my daily life.

I’m a curious, motivated individual who believes in continuous growth and making the most out of every opportunity—whether it’s in the office, the classroom, or at home.
