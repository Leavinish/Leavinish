### 💼 Career Journey


🏢 2024–Present – Admin Assistant @ UTM International
Since 2024, I’ve been working as an Administrative Assistant at UTM International. I support the International Student Scholar and Services department by assisting students with visa renewals, delivering iKad cards, and responding to inquiries through face-to-face interactions, WhatsApp, and email. I also prepare essential documents like personal bonds and official letters for the Immigration Department and EMGS, and I help troubleshoot issues with the QMS system at the service counter.

🏪 2023 – Branch Supervisor @ 99 Speedmart
In 2023, I joined 99 Speedmart as a Branch Supervisor. I was responsible for handling goods receiving and returns, maintaining store cleanliness and safety, and ensuring proper pricing and labeling of products. I also oversaw the outlet in the absence of the manager and handled daily cash flow at the counters.

🧠 2022 – AI Data Annotator @ Pactera Edge
In 2022, I worked as an AI Data Annotator at Pactera Edge for a project in collaboration with Microsoft (Edge AI). My main tasks included testing and training AI systems using CVAT software. I provided accurate data annotations and contributed to improving AI command recognition and overall system performance.

🛠️ 2021 – Internship @ Matrics Concepts
During my internship at Matrics Concepts in 2021, I was actively involved in site supervision. I monitored the progress of on-site construction, provided updates to my superiors, and read architectural and structural plans to ensure that all work was carried out accurately. I also received construction materials and managed site workers to make sure everything ran smoothly.
